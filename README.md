# GS/EECS 6414 Final Project: Social Networks - The Tracking of COVID-19 Misinformation Using NLP and Graph-based Approaches

## Installation 
1. To run our application, please ensure that you have installed the following dependencies:
```
pip install streamlit
pip install plotly-express
pip install wordcloud
pip install networkx
pip install tqdm
pip install networkx
pip install powerlaw
pip install praw
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib
pip install pillow
```
2. Unfortunately, the finetuned large language model was too large to upload onto GitHub. We have provided the training script for you to obtain the model with its respective tokenizer. Please refer to [archive/QA_LLM.ipynb](https://github.com/stoyonaga/EECS6414_SocialNetworks/blob/main/archive/Twitter/QA_LLM.ipynb) and use [datasets/qa_data.json](https://github.com/stoyonaga/EECS6414_SocialNetworks/blob/main/datasets/qa_data.json) as the input file. You should place the model and tokenizer in a model directory that resides within the root of the project.
