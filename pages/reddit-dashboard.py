        The goal of our project is to create a robust multifold analytics and visualization system for COVID misinformation 
        in Twitter. Firstly, we will analyze several datasets which contain social media posts about COVID-19 in addition to 
        user-level demographics (i.e., Number of Followers, Biography, etc.,). From this, we will apply NLP techniques which augment 
        the available datasets for data mining and visualization purposes. 


        Secondly, we will create directed social networks with malicious posts and tagged users to determine how misinformation travels. 
        The resulting network characteristics will be reported in the methodology section. Using these characteristics, we will determine what 
        null model most closely corresponds to our social networks.
        

        Lastly, through the process of data analytics, graph visualization, and pattern recognition, we seek to answer the 
        following research questions based on various subgraph motifs:

        1. Which users participate the most in the dissemination of misinformation?
        2. What NLP-based patterns can be drawn from users who spread misinformation?
        3. How is misinformation propagated in terms of a longitudinal time frame?
        4. What are notable similarities and differences in how misinformation spreads between Twitter and Reddit?
